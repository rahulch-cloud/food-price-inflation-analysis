# Food Price Inflation Analysis (1974–2026)

**Analyzing 50 years of USDA Producer Price Index (PPI) data to understand food inflation trends at the wholesale and farm level.**

## 🎯 Goal

To analyze Producer Price Index (PPI) data and identify price trends, volatility patterns, and historical crisis comparisons across food categories from 1974–2026.

## 🔍 Key Questions

1. Which decade experienced the highest food price inflation?
2. How does the 2020s inflation episode compare to the 1970s oil crisis period?
3. Which food categories show the highest price volatility?
4. What patterns can we identify over 50 years of data?
5. What insights can help farmers, businesses, and consumers?

## 📊 Key Findings (So Far)
