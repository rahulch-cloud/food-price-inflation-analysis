# Food Price Regional & Seasonal Analysis

## Business Problem
Food prices vary significantly across US regions and show seasonal patterns that impact both consumers and supply chain planning. This project analyzes USDA CPI data to identify regional price disparities, seasonal trends, and provide actionable insights for retailers and consumers.

## Key Questions
1. Which US regions experience the highest food price inflation rates?
2. How do seasonal patterns affect different food categories (produce, meat, dairy)?
3. What regional price differences exist for the same food categories?
4. Can we forecast seasonal price peaks to help consumers plan purchases?
5. What supply chain insights can we derive from regional price variations?

## Tools & Technologies
- **SQL**: Regional data querying and aggregation
- **Python**: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
- **Excel**: Pivot tables for regional comparisons
- **Visualization**: Geographic heatmaps and seasonal trend analysis
